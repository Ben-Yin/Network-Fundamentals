HTTP server:
For HTTP server, we use a built-in library in the "com.sun.net.httpserver" package to implement it.
After the server is started, we use a handler (namely a proxy) to process all requests sent from clients. Before
 making the response, we check whether the requested page is in the cache. If it's in the cache, we return the data in
 the local file directly. Otherwise we will get data from the origin server by http request, and then write it into
 cache based on the cache algorithm.

DNS server:
For DNS server, we use the DatagramSocket, that is, implement it based on UDP.
After the server is started, we listen to the startup port to capture all DNS requests and then parse them according to
 the DNS protocol specification. If it's a DNS query and the query domain name is the specific one used in this project
 , we will use the request IP address, together with current measurements of all replica servers, to compute the best
 replica server for this request. After that, we build an answer containing the result IP and write back into the socket.


To improve the performance, we use the cache mechanism to "memory" the pages that have been requested.
And since the disk quota for our cache is 10MB, to enhance the hit rate while limiting the total cache size, we use a
cache algorithm - ARC, to fulfill the cache function.


challenges:
1. The implementation of DNS server is a bit tricky, since we need to compose the DNS packet manually, which is not
 familiar to us;
2. The ARC cache algorithm is not quite easy to implement, because it's a more advanced algorithm than the commonly used
 LRU.


We also write script to easily manage the multiple servers of our CDN.
Through running these scripts, we can deploy/run/stop CDN with only one command.
Typical use for them are shown as following:

for deploy:
./deployCDN -p 40017 -o http://ec2-54-167-4-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080 -n cs5700cdn.example.com -u fredzhang -i id_rsa_cs5700

for run:
./runCDN -p 40017 -o http://ec2-54-167-4-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080 -n cs5700cdn.example.com -u fredzhang -i id_rsa_cs5700

for stop:
./stopCDN -p 40017 -o http://ec2-54-167-4-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080 -n cs5700cdn.example.com -u fredzhang -i id_rsa_cs5700
